        <br><br>
	Deep learning is not a requirement in building an intelligent natural language processing or computer vision mobile app. So why does a company like Google now use deep neural nets for voice search (Google app), photo search (Google Photos), translation (Google Translate), and for Smart Reply (in Inbox)? <br><br>
In short, deep learning makes fewer mistakes than traditional machine learning methods. Deep learning, enabled by slightly better methods, more data, and more computing power, each of which have become accessible in only the first and second decades of this century, is now the default technology for these Google apps for the logical reason that it makes fewer mistakes. You need only look at the landscape of readily available traditional machine learning demonstration apps to motivate your interest in applying deep learning. <br><br> You can look at a selection of these apps below. This is an example of  what I can download from Github, run on my phone, and build off of as open source code today. You can see that these apps are very smart, but none  of them have an error rate low enough to really render them useful for anything more than low-consequence domains, such as consumer photo editing or educational technology, where a small number of errors are not medically harmful and may even go unnoticed. <br><br>1.
